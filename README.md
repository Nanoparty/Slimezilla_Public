A Bullet-Hell Survival game about a slime taking on the Kingdom. Made for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2. Paid assets have been removed.

You take the crown and become the King of all slimes, but the human kingdom is not happy. There can be only one king. Join forces with your fellow slimes and fight back against the seemly infinite forces of the human kingdom.

Vampire Survivors inspired survival bullet-hell game. Merge with other slimes to heal yourself and grow in size. Collect gems from fallen knights to unlock upgrades and transform from a King slime to a God slime.
